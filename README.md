# course-48
A 2048 realization using python and pygame for my coursework paper

Course-48 is a small project I made using PyGame to create my implementation of the famous game "2048", where you have to combine equal numbers to get the 2048 number.
It was made for my coursework, and it is, I would say, a rip-off of the original game, so it is here just to show that i am a programmer!
